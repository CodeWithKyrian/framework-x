* Hot topic for PHP 8.1
* Async APIs that look just like their synchronous counterparts
* Much easier to integrate, possibly larger ecosystem in future
* Requires PHP 8.1 (November 2021), adoption will take time
* [Promises](promises.md) still required for concurrent execution
* [Promises](promises.md) and [Coroutines](coroutines.md) work just fine until ecosystem matures
