* Avoid blocking ([databases](../integrations/database.md), [filesystem](../integrations/filesystem.md), etc.)
* Deferred execution
* Concurrent execution more efficient than [multithreading](child-processes.md)
* API can be a bit harder (see [Coroutines](coroutines.md) or [Fibers](fibers.md))
* See [reactphp/promise](https://reactphp.org/promise/)
* Avoid blocking by moving blocking implementation to [child process](child-processes.md)
