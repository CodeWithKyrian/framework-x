Framework X will be released as open-source under the permissive MIT license.
This means it will be free as in free speech and as in free beer.

We believe in open source and made a conscious decision to take this path.
Being open-source means we can foster a community to focus on building the best possible framework together.
Framework X builds on top of existing open-source projects and we want to give back to this community of awesome engineers and developers.
Being open to outside contributions means we can guarantee interoperability with a vivid ecosystem and ensure the longevity of the project.
