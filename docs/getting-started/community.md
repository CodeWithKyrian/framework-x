# Community

Framework X is so much more than *yet another framework*, it is the way to
introduce asynchronous programming to the broader PHP community. We believe it's
essential to involve the whole community in all our processes and provide you
with the opportunity to bring up your awesome ideas.

## Open source

Framework X is released as open-source under the permissive MIT license.
This means it is free as in free speech and as in free beer.

We believe in open source and made a conscious decision to take this path.
Being open-source means we can foster a community to focus on building the best possible framework together.
Framework X builds on top of existing open-source projects and we want to give back to this community of awesome engineers and developers.
Being open to outside contributions means we can guarantee interoperability with a vivid ecosystem and ensure the longevity of the project.
